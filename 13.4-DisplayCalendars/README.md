# SETUP EXAMPLE

This Project is a working Calendar that takes the month and year as input. This app is programmed in java and uses the calender and gregorian calendar util imports.

## Example Output

## Analysis Steps

When making this calendar I thought about the layout and how it should function. I decided that putting the month and year in were the only necessary requirements for functionality on the user side as I could have added a specific date input however I chose not to.

### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?
I desigined this app with the scanner util for user input and used only 1 class as I mainly made use of loops and not much of the information needs to change after the initial month and year input.

### Testing / Notes

I fist started by making sure every month 1 being jan through 12 being dec displayed the way I wanted. I then made sure that the years did not affect my output display.

The hardest part was getting the spacing right between the days of the week and the first of the month. This took some trial and error but I eventually got it.
