This Project is an app that uses the javafx library to create a hangman display.

## Output

## Analysis Steps

When making this display, I thought about the setup and how it should be organized. I decided that 3 observablelists for 3 polylines would be the best way to aproach the drawing.

### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?
I desigined this app with the idea of 3 sections with the hang pole tripling as the pole, rope, and torso of the stick person. I used only 1 public class.

### Testing / Notes

Testing this I played around with the list array points (x1,y1)... to change the lengths and overall flow of the polylines to create the hangman drawing.
