This Project is an app that uses the javafx library to create a hangman display.

## Output

![Sample Output](README.JPG)

## Analysis Steps

When making this display, I utilized the java keyframes and javafx.

### Design

I decided to have my car move from left to right and when hitting the right edge wrapping back to the left side to look like it is doing a lap.

### Testing / Notes

Testing this I played around with keyframes and the duration to find a speed that worked for the animation.
