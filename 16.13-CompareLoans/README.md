This Project is an app that uses the javafx library to create a hangman display.

## Output

![Sample Output](README.JPG)

## Analysis Steps

When making this display, I utilized the javafx framework. This excercise allowed me to work with the setOnAction method for event handling as well as running operations on different events.

### Design

This app calculates loan interest rates from 5% to 8%. based off the loan amount and number of years of the loan.

### Testing / Notes

Testing this I played around with the math and making sure the eventhandler that I placed on my button was working.
