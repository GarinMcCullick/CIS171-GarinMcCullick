This Project is an app that uses the javafx library to create two text fields that can dynamically be adjusted via Pos properties.

## Output

## Analysis Steps

When making this display, I created 4 hboxes named 1-4, and 1 vbox. the hboxes are nested inide the vbox. there are two text fields and 3 radio buttons used to change the properties of the first text field. and the second text field changes the width of the first text field.

### Design

This was a fun project. It allowed me to play with Pos properties inside javafx. This program was designed to dynamically change the size and horizontal positioning of the main textfield.

### Testing / Notes

To test this application I toggled between all 3 radio buttons insuring they worked as intended as well as changing the number value typed and entered into the 2nd textfield to ensure the main textfield was being adjusted accordingly.
