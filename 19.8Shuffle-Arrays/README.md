This Project is an app that uses the java maven library to create a shuffled ArrayList.

## Output

![Sample Output](README.JPG)

## Analysis Steps

When making this I created a class of Person, and an ArrayList of People. Where a person is an object with multiple properties and is put into an ArrayList of People.
### Design

This project allowed me to play with arrayLists and generic types inside java. This program was designed to be able to create a "person" and fetch said person from a list of "people".

### Testing / Notes

To test this application I made sure the collections.shuffle method shuffled the array list.
