This Project is an app that uses the java maven library to create a sorted array using Radix sort.

## Output

![Sample Output](README.JPG)

## Analysis Steps

When making this I created an array that has a max size of 1,000,000 and each spot in that array is a randomly generated number that I then sorted using Radix.
### Design

This project allowed me to play with arrays and random numbers as well as the Random class and buckets with Radix Sort.

### Testing / Notes

To test this application I changed the max array values as well as the sorting values on the array.
