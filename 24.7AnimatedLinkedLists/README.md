## Analysis Steps

When making this I created an Linked List that you can append values to search for values and delete values inside of the list.
### Design

This project allowed me to learn about nodes and linked lists inside java as well as learn how to create functionality when working with lists in java such as appending, deleting, and searching lists.

### Testing / Notes

To test this application I changed printed out the linked list and tested adding values, deleting values, and searching for values inside the list. I made sure that when searching for a value you must search for a number as this is a linked list of integers. I also made sure to use try and catch statements for error handling and error messages such as searching for or deleting values that are not in the list.
