## Output

![Sample Output](README.JPG)

## Analysis Steps

When making this display, I used textfields, panes, buttons, and labels as well as positioning methods.
### Design

This was a fun project. It allowed me to play with Pos properties, editable and non-editable textfields, and event handlers using try and catch.

### Testing / Notes

To test this application I worked with multiple doubles to ensure the exchange was correct I made sure that the sizing was dynamic and responsive. as well as making sure that my event handler caught any non digit or wrong formatting.
