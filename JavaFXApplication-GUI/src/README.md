This Project is an app that uses the javafx library to create gui's and displays.

## Output

![Sample Output](README.jpeg)

## Analysis Steps

When making this display, I thought about the setup and how it should be organized. I used several imports from the javafx library as well.

### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?
I desigined this app with a header at the top and a button on the bottom of the display.

### Testing / Notes

To test this app you have to run the program from the file to see the display.
