##How To Guide

I designed this to be simple and straight forward. There are no animations its mainly text based. The first step is to run the app. Once the App opens you will go through the different drop down menus selecting the items you want on your sandwich. For veggies you will type in the ingrediants you want and then you will submit your order. Upon submitting your order an alert will pop up with the ingrediants you ordered as a summary.
